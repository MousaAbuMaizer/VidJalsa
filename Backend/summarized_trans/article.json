This device is not just a piece of hardware and software, it is a revolution, changing the way users interact with their digital surroundings. With Vision Pro, we are not just talking about another device, but a portal to a new immersive digital world.", "When worn, the Apple Vision Pro integrates your favorite apps into your surroundings. Thanks to visionOS, Apple's first spatial operating system, you can navigate with your eyes, select with a tap, scroll with a flick, and dictate with your voice. The apps have dimensions, react to light, and cast shadows, giving you the feeling that they are physically present in your space.", "Apple Vision Pro ensures that using it does not isolate you from others. You can still see others in the room and they can see you. The lack of a display allows the apps to live in your space. Your photos can be life-sized, transforming your living room into a gallery. You can even relive memories with Apple Vision Pro's 3D camera, capturing photos and videos with remarkable depth.", "The device also transforms your entertainment experience. It brings the scale and wonder of a movie theater to your space, providing a cinematic experience with spatial audio that surrounds you. You can create a massive screen for gaming, connect your controller, and enjoy incredible audio.", "Apple Vision Pro also revolutionizes your workspace. The web comes to life at a fantastic scale, making browsing the internet a brand new experience. You can work seamlessly across your favorite apps from Apple and the App Store. You can see people life-size and hear them as if they're in front of you during a FaceTime call, making conversation more natural and collaboration easier.", "Apple Vision Pro is not just about work and entertainment, it also allows you to transform your space with Environments. You can watch a movie on a huge screen in a stunning location, even while on a plane. The device is remarkably compact and beautiful, designed with a single piece of three-dimensionally formed laminated glass and a lightweight aluminum alloy frame.", "The device uses advanced machine learning to represent you realistically when you're in FaceTime. Your Persona dynamically reflects your face and hand movements, so people see your eyes, hands, and true expressions. It also features a micro-OLED display system that provides more than a 4K TV for each eye, giving you jaw-dropping, lifelike clarity.", "Apple Vision Pro is powered by an innovative dual-chip design. The M2 provides phenomenal performance and the R1 processes sensor data at incredible speed, virtually eliminating lag. This makes Apple Vision Pro a stunning new way to use apps, relive memories, be together, and be immersed in entertainment. The era of spatial computing is here with Apple Vision Pro."]}
